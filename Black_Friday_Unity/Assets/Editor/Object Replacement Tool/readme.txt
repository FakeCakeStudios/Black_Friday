Object Replacement Tool, v1.0.4
Developed by Tylah Heil at Silver Fox Games.

-------

About: 
Object Replacement Tool is designed to make replacing GameObjects in the editor a breeze. Got some shiny new assets from the 3D Artist to replace those drab, boring placeholders? replace them quickly and easily without having to reposition by hand. Just select an object, drag in the replacement and hit the Replace button, it's just that easy!

Object Replacement Tool also features the ability to add objects without replacing the selected reference, it even allows for mass object placement at incremental position, rotation, and scale.

-------

How to use Replace Object Tool:

- Select a GameObject in the Scene view or search for an object using the search field.
- Go to the 'GameObject' menu and select 'Replace Objectâ€¦' to bring up the 'Replace Object' dialogue window.
- Drag a replacement Prefab from the Project window to the 'Replacement Object' slot within the Replace object window.
- Select a function to perform, you can choose to completely replace the selection or to add the replacement object at the selection's coordinates and leave the selection alone. 
- You have the option of transferring the Transform data (Position, Rotation, and Scale) of the selected object to the replacement object or resetting them to a default state.
- You can also set a transform offset for each added object.
- Click the context sensitive 'Replace Selection' or 'Add Selection' button and you're done.
