These icons fit in the squares on the appropriate (offense, defense, speed) buttons. (On Press)
I found that scaling them down to 28% they fit just fine. Let me know if you want me to 
rescale and send you the file again. One player presses the icon... display "select frame"
and show the icon description in the appropriate window.
